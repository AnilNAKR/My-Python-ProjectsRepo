# Pong Game with Python Turtle
Pong is a classic arcade game that simulates table tennis. This project implements a simple version of Pong using Python's Turtle module. Players control paddles on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points by making the ball pass your opponent's paddle.

## Features
* **Interactive Gameplay**: Control paddles using keyboard keys (Up and Down arrow keys for the right paddle, and W and S keys for the left paddle).
* **Ball Movement:** The ball moves continuously across the screen, bouncing off the paddles and edges.
* **Scorekeeping**: Keep track of the score for each player with a scoreboard displayed on the screen.
* **Ball Bouncing:** The ball bounces off the paddles and edges of the screen to simulate realistic gameplay.
* **Game Over Detection:** The game ends when one player misses the ball, and the opponent scores a point.

## Usage
* **Controls:** Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down, and the W and S keys to move the left paddle up and down.
* **Scoring:** Earn points by successfully hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle while preventing the ball from passing your own paddle.
* **Game Over:** The game ends when one player misses the ball, and the opponent scores a point. The scoreboard displays the final score.
