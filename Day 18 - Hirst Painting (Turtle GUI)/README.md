### Random Hirst Dot Painting with Turtle

This Python program generates a random dot painting using the Turtle module. It creates a canvas of dots in various colors extracted from an image.

#### How It Works

1.  **Importing Modules:** The program imports necessary modules such as `Turtle` and `Screen`.

2.  **Setting Up Turtle:** Turtle module settings are configured, including color mode and setting up the turtle.

3.  **Generating Dots:** Random dots are generated on the canvas using a loop. Each dot has a random color chosen from a predefined list of colors.

4.  **Organizing Dots:** The dots are organized into a grid pattern with each row containing 10 dots.

5.  **Extracting Colors:** Additional colors are extracted from an image file using the `colorgram` library. These colors are then added to the color list.

6.  **Running the Program:** The program is executed, displaying the dot painting on the screen.

#### Usage

1.  **Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You may need to install the `colorgram` library if not already installed (`pip install colorgram.py`).

2.  **Running the Program:** Execute the Python script(mainProject.py). It will display the dot painting on the screen using the Turtle module.
