# Quiz App
**This Python quiz app allows users to answer True or False questions. The app tracks correct and incorrect answers, providing a final score upon completion.**

2) Answer Questions: Answer the True or False questions presented by the app.

**How It Works**

* The app imports questions from question_model.py and data.py.
* It creates a list of Question objects based on the imported data.
* A QuizBrain instance is initialized with the question bank.
* The app iterates through the questions, prompting the user for True or False answers.
* Correct and incorrect answers are tracked, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
