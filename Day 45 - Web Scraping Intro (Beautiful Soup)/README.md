Web Scraping Projects
=====================

This repository contains three web scraping projects using Python and BeautifulSoup. Each project demonstrates different web scraping techniques and their applications, such as extracting data from static web pages, scraping and saving data to an Excel file, and creating a list from a web archive page.

Projects Overview
-----------------

### Part 1: BeautifulSoup Intro

This part introduces the basics of web scraping using BeautifulSoup. It includes examples of how to read and parse HTML content, extract specific elements using tags, ids, classes, and CSS selectors.

#### Code Highlights

-   **Reading HTML Content:** Opens and reads the `website.html` file.
-   **Parsing HTML:** Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
-   **Extracting Elements:** Demonstrates how to extract elements like title, anchor tags, headings, and elements by class or id.
-   **CSS Selectors:** Shows how to use CSS selectors to extract specific elements.

### Part 2: Top Rated Article

This part demonstrates how to scrape the Hacker News website to find and extract the top-rated articles based on their scores. The extracted data is then saved to an Excel file using OpenPyXL.

#### Code Highlights

-   **Fetching Web Page:** Uses `requests` to get the HTML content of the Hacker News page.
-   **Parsing HTML:** Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
-   **Extracting Articles:** Finds article titles, links, and scores.
-   **Saving to Excel:** Saves the extracted data to an Excel file.

### Part 3: Top 100 Movies List

This part scrapes a web archive page to extract the list of top 100 movies. The movies are then saved to a text file in reverse order.

#### Code Highlights

-   **Fetching Web Page:** Uses `requests` to get the HTML content from a web archive page.

-   **Extracting Movie Titles:** Finds and extracts movie titles.
-   **Saving to Text File:** Saves the movie titles to a text file in reverse order.
