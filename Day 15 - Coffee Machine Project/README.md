# Coffee Machine
This Coffee Machine project simulates the operation of a coffee vending machine. It allows users to select from a menu of different coffee options, check the available resources, and make payments using coins. The program ensures that there are sufficient resources to fulfill the user's order and provides appropriate feedback.

## Features
* Menu Selection: Users can choose from a menu of different coffee options, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
* Resource Availability: The program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, and coffee) to fulfill the user's order.
* Payment Processing: Users can pay for their order using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The program calculates the total amount and provides change if necessary.
* Report Generation: Users can generate a report to view the current levels of available resources and the cash reserve.

## Usage
1) Run the program.
2) Choose a coffee option from the menu (espresso/latte/cappuccino).
3) If prompted, enter the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to make the payment.
4) Wait for your coffee to be dispensed.
5) Optionally, generate a report to view the current status of available resources and cash reserve.
