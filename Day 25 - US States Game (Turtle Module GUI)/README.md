# U.S. States Names Game
This project is an interactive game built with Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game challenges players to guess the names of all 50 U.S. states by clicking on a map of the United States.

## How to Play
1) Run the script to start the game.
2) A window will appear with a map of the United States, featuring blank outlines of each state.
3) Enter the name of a U.S. state into the prompt window that appears.
4) If the entered state name is correct, the script will fill in the corresponding state on the map.
5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you correctly guess all 50 states or choose to exit the game.

## Features
* **Interactive map:** Click on a blank state to guess its name.
* **Progress tracking:** Keep track of the number of correct guesses out of 50.
* **Exit option:** Enter "exit" to stop the game and save a list of missed states to a CSV file for later review.
