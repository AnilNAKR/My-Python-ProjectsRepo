# Snake Game
This Python project is a classic Snake game built using the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

## Introduction
Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where players control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food. The objective is to navigate the snake around the screen, eating food pellets to score points without colliding with the snake's own body or the walls of the game area.

# How to Play
1) Run the Python script to start the game.
2) Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of the snake.
3) Guide the snake to eat the food pellets that appear on the screen.
4) The snake will grow longer each time it eats food.
5) Avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.
6) The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

# Features
* Smooth and responsive snake movement controlled by arrow keys.
* Colorful graphics and visual feedback using Turtle graphics.
* Randomly generated food pellets for the snake to eat.
* Score tracking to keep track of the player's performance.
* Game over detection when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
* Ability to restart the game after a game over.
